# Frontend-Coding-Quizz

## Description 

This is a short multiple choice quiz created mainly using javascript and applying APIs. I have been learning front end coding for the last 4 weeks and wanting to implement what ive learnt, i decided to create a javascript quizz using APIs. The questions/answers within this quizz are all javacsript related. There is a timer within this quiz starting at 100seconds and for every incorect answer, a penalty of 10 seconds are deducted. The final score is the amount of time left, and you are able to put your initials/name down to track your scores. This is implemented via local storage and JSON.

## Usage

To start the quizz, click the button start. Click on each multiple choice button to select your answer. If you are correct, there will be a short display at the bottom of the choices that show "Correct!" and it will dissapear. If you are wrong, a short text displaying "Wrong!" and 10 seconds will be deducted.

After the quiz, you are shown your score, and are able to write ur name/initials. That data is also tracked using local storage.
